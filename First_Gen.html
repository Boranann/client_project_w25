                <p>The First-Generation Student Program is grounded in a history of student activism. First-Generation
                    College Students @UM, a student organization, was founded in 2007 with the mission to increase
                    accessibility to resources for first-generation students and to build community among the
                    population.
                    The students advocated for greater campus support for themselves and other peer first-generation
                    students. In 2017, University of Michigan hired the inaugural first First-Generation Program
                    Manager,
                    established the First-Generation Gateway Office, and launched multiple initiatives to increase
                    first-generation student success. As a result, student engagement has increased significantly since
                    2017
                    and University of Michigan’s first-generation efforts have received national recognition.</p>

                <h2>Definition of First Generation</h2>
                <p>At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation
                    college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a 4-year college or university degree.
                    This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.)
                    who
                    have completed a four-year degree. </p>
